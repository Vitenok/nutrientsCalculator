====================

Calculator lets user to calculate weight of chosen products in relation to daily energy intake.

Firstly user chooses how many calories and which products he/she wants to consume.

This calculation becomes complex because proper fitness menu has restrictions on how many
macronutrients (proteins, fats and carbohydrates) can be consumed by athlete.
Here the problem gets multidimensional and difficult to solve "by hand".

This calculator is an attempt to solve such problem by solving linear systems of equations.
